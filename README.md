#  New Booking Entry 

I originally built this feature using JavaScript, with my own structure  separate validation logic, custom hooks, and clear state handling. That’s the stack I’m most comfortable with, and where I have a strong understanding of what’s happening under the hood.

I later had some extra time and decided to rebuild the same feature using TypeScript and Mantine to explore a more modern stack and UI library. While I used ChatGPT as a helper during this phase, the goal was learning and experimentation rather than claiming deep expertise in Mantine.

I’m including this repository as well to show my ability to adapt, learn new tools quickly, and work with TypeScript-based setups  even if it’s not my primary comfort zone yet.
